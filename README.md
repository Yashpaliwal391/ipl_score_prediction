## About

Cricket is one of the most popular sports in India, and the Indian Premier League (IPL) is a major cricket tournament that attracts millions of fans worldwide. Predicting match scores can be both challenging and exciting. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict IPL match scores, providing cricket enthusiasts and analysts with a valuable tool for match analysis and predictions.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the IPL Score Prediction project.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-score-prediction.git

## Usage

1. Data Preparation: Ensure you have the latest IPL match data. You can use your own dataset or find one online. Place the 
   data file in the project directory.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by running the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py --input data.csv --output preprocessed_data.csv

3. Training the Model: Train the score prediction model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --input preprocessed_data.csv --output model.pkl

4. Making Predictions: Use the trained model to make score predictions for upcoming IPL matches:
   ```bash
   python predict_scores.py --model model.pkl --input match_data.csv

5. View Predictions: View the predicted scores and analyze the results in the generated output file.

## Data
The project relies on historical IPL match data, including information about teams, players, venues, and match conditions. You can obtain IPL data from various sources, such as Kaggle or official IPL websites.

## Model
The IPL Score Prediction model uses machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to learn from historical data and make score predictions. The model is trained on features such as team performance, player statistics, and venue conditions.
